"""Utilities for resolving USD path specs consistently (URLs/local paths) and
constructing Isaac Lab Nucleus paths like the upstream project.

Designed to mirror Isaac Lab behavior:
- Supports omniverse/HTTP(S) URLs and local filesystem paths.
- Expands environment variables and normalizes slashes.
- Joins relative paths against the provided repo_root when given a relative path.
- Provides ``isaaclab_asset_path()`` that builds URLs using the configured Nucleus root
    setting (``/persistent/isaac/asset_root/cloud``) â†’ ``<root>/Isaac/IsaacLab/<rel>``.
